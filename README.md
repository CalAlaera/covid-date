## Authorship note
Although I came up with this myself, and I programmed it from scratch, I am under no illusion that I was the first to come up with this. We all know about sepdate and the idea of applying it to covid-19 is, frankly, obvious. I therefore claim no authorship right over this script and dedicate any original work I may have put into it to the Public Domain.
